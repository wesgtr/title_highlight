# Title Highlight

## Description
The "Title Highlight" plugin for WordPress allows you to highlight specific words or phrases in the main title of pages and posts, offering a visual way to draw attention to important content or keywords. Ideal for websites looking to improve user experience and the visibility of specific terms.

## Features
- **Automatic Highlighting**: Automatically highlights words or phrases configured in the plugin settings.
- **CSS Customization**: Currently, customization of the highlight style, including color, font size, and font family, is done through the `highlight_title.css` file.

## Installation
1. Navigate to the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress admin panel, click 'Add New'.
2. Upload the plugin manually and install.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Customization
Currently, customization of the highlight style is performed directly in the `highlight_title.css` file within the plugin folder. You can edit this file to change the color, font size, and font family according to your preferences.

## Upcoming Improvements
Add a configuration area in the WordPress admin panel, allowing users to easily customize visual aspects of the highlight, such as color, font size, and font family, without the need to directly edit the CSS file.
